        <p class="lead">Welcome to my Home page. I am a full time student at California State Univeristity Long Beach. I was born in Fountain Valley, California, and I as of now I am 19 years old. I decidied to go with Pre-Computer Engineering as I was fond of computers in general and how it has improved over years in terms of performance. Video games have a large impact on this decision as well since games have also gotten better over the years in how they work and their graphics as well . I hope to learn as much as I can while I am in college so that I can be better prepared for when I actually become a computer engineer.

I am a only child and both of my parents are Vietnamese, so of course that means that I am Vietnamese American. My parents didn't finish their high school education while in Vietnam, so being able to go to a four year college was very motivating. </p>
